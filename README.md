# Rnd-Works
These are the works done by me as part of RND course

I have done these projects as assignments for RND course.I used django and python to complete a web app named ToDoapp and now i am trying to link it with backbone using rest api.

In c i have written a program which uses c sockets and stores the files(images,videos,audios etc) in a binary file and they can be retrieved.There can be any number of users and the file be less than 900mb.I am trying introduce posix threads and allow parallel use access for different customers.
